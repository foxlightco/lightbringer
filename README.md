## What is this?
[This oath](https://github.com/foxlightco/lightbringer/blob/master/oath.md) is a public way for people to [state their commitment to ethical conduct](https://github.com/foxlightco/lightbringer/edit/master/committers.md), and open up discussion for what ethical behavior means in the context of software engineering

## Why make this?
Computer scientists, software engineers and security researchers are entrusted with tremendous access and responsibility, while being faced with hard choices and tempting incentives: 

- [to mis-use user data](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/06/spokeo-pay-800000-settle-ftc-charges-company-allegedly-marketed)
- [to abuse privileges for personal gain](http://www.mercercountyprosecutor.com/press/Motor%20Vehicle.pdf)
- [to build spying tools](http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/category/corporate-enemies/)
